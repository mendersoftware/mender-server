  title: Device inventory
  description: |
    An API for device attribute management and device grouping. Intended for use by the web GUI.

    Devices can upload vendor-specific attributes (software/hardware info, health checks, metrics, etc.) of various data types to the backend.

    This API enables the user to:
    * list devices with their attributes
    * search devices by attribute value
    * use the results to create and manage device groups for the purpose of deployment scheduling
  version: "1"

      summary: List devices inventories
      description: |
        Returns a paged collection of devices and their attributes.
        Accepts optional search and sort parameters.

        **Searching**<br/>
        Searching by attributes values is accomplished by appending attribute
        filters in the form `{scope}/{name}={value}` to the query string.

        Supported values for scope are:
          * __inventory__: Attributes reported by the device.
          * __system__: Attributes populated by the mender-server.
          * __identity__: Device's identity attributes provided in the device's auth request.
          * __monitor__: Attributes populated by the monitoring add-on.
          * __tags__: User-defined attributes associated with the device.

        Using an unsupported value for __scope__ will produce no results from this API except
        when no scope is present, in which case scope defaults to inventory.

        Examples:
        ```
        # Search for devices with inventory attribute `attr_name_1` and tag attribute `attr_name_2`
        GET /devices?inventory/attr_name_1=foo&tags/attr_name_2=100

        # Search devices by attribute without scope (inventory scope is used)
        GET /devices?attr_name_1=foo
        ```

          Sort devices by attribute.
          The parameter is formatted as a comma-separated list of attribute
          names and sort order.

          The order direction (`ord`) must be either `asc` or `desc` for
          ascending and descending respectively.
          Defaults to `desc` if not specified.

          For example: `?sort=attr1:asc,attr2:desc`
          will sort by 'attr1' ascending, and then by 'attr2' descending.
