        Returns a filtered collection of deployments in the system,
        including active and historical. If both 'status' and 'query' are
        not specified, all devices are listed.

        DEPRECATED: _since Mon Oct 21 2024_ we deprecated the endpoint due to an issue with the "search" query
          behavior. Please use the v2 /deployments/deployments endpoint instead.
          In the new endpoint, we replaced search parameter with the "id" and "name" parameters.
