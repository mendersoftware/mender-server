        Returns a filtered collection of deployments in the system,
        including active and historical. If both 'status' and 'query' are
        not specified, all devices are listed.

        DEPRECATED: we deprecated the endpoint due to an issue with the "search" query
          behavior. Please use the v2 /deployments/deployments endpoint instead.
          In the new endpoint, we replaced search parameter with the "id" and "name" parameters.

        Devices for which there are no compatible artifacts to be installed are

        If there is no artifacts for the deployment, deployment will not be created
