### Bug Fixes


- *(deployments)* Deprecate v1 endpoint for listing deployments
([MEN-7543](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7543)) ([879b589](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/879b58986f7e34906cff649c687d47de9152455c))  by @kjaskiewiczz


  We deprecated GET v1 /deployments/deployments endpoint because of an
  issue with "search" query parameter behavior. As a replacement we
  introduce v2 version of the endpoint, where we replaced "search"
  parameter with "id" and "name" parameters.

- *(deviceconfig)* Enable multiplatform build

  - **BREAKING**: Generate artifacts API ignores `storage.proxy_uri` and
`aws.external_url` configuration values and instead access the API using
the same URL as deployments service.


  When generating artifacts, the backend will use the direct access URL
  instead of rewriting the URL using the configured `storage.proxy_uri` or
  `aws.external_url`.
- Deployment device count should not exceed max devices
([MEN-7847](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7847)) ([15e5fee](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/15e5feec727e4257a1ee4345265146a194edb4ab))  by @alfrunes

- *(create-artifact-worker)* do not install openssl1.1-compat

  Changes:

  - use mender-artifact which does not depend on openssl1.1-compat
  - do not install openssl1.1-compat
- *(deployments)* Accesslog catches panic traces and remove "dev" middleware ([MC-7155](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MC-7155))
- *(deployments)* Improve error message when uploading too large artifacts ([MEN-7175](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7175))
- *(deployments)* fix release filtering and RBAC for releases
-  (deployments)* With the old implementation, when using more than one tag in the filter, or when using role which grants access to releases with given tag (and more than one tag was specified), deployments will present only releases containg ALL the tags each. With the new behavior, deployments will retrun all the releases containg ANY of the tags. ([MEN-7272](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7272))
- *(deployments)* Compatibility with MongoDB \> 5.0 ([MEN-6956](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6956))
- *(deviceauth)* Handling preauthorized auth set when device is accepted
- *(deviceauth)* The previous behavior was putting the device in a conflicting state and returning 500 errors on auth requests. With this commit, the preauthorized auth set will take precedence and take over as the accepted auth set. ([ALV-213](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ALV-213))
- *(deviceauth)* Wrong Content-Type header on successful authentication
- *(deviceauth)* On success, the Content-Type header is set to `application/jwt` instead of invalid `application/json` on 200 responses to POST /api/devices/v1/authentication/auth\_requests ([MEN-6912](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6912))
- *(deviceauth)* Preauthorize force behavior applies to existing auth sets
- *(deviceauth)* Updates the behavior of the Preauthorize endpoint if "force" paremeter is set:
   * If an authset already exist, the status will be forced to "preauthorized".
   * If the auth set does not exist, a new one will be created. ([MEN-7241](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7241))
- *(deviceauth)* Inconsistent device `check_in_time` when listing devices

  The lookup for `check_in_time` from the cache does not work when running Redis in cluster mode because of the MGET command requires keys to hash to the same slot. This commit replaces MGET with multiple batched GET commands when running Redis in cluster mode. ([MEN-7337](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7337))

- *(gui)* fixed an issue that would prevent promoting a device to a gateway device ([MEN-7334](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7334))
- *(gui)* limited global settings saving for less privileged users ([MEN-6970](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6970))

  The generated key is serialized using (RFC5915) ASN.1 encoding, but encoded to PEM using PKCS8 (RFC5208) block header/trailer. ([MEN-7478](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7478), \[SEC 1\]([https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/SEC](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/SEC) 1))

### Build

- (gui) **BREAKING**: Changed container image to unprivileged port 8090 and unprivileged user ([13b2268](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/13b2268027f678e52ce69aa8bfa912c713d12093)) by @alfrunes

- (docker) **BREAKING**: Changed container image tag scheme from `mender-x.y.z` to `vX.Y.Z`

  The new versioning scheme uses the **Mender Server** version which is decoupled from the other components in the Mender ecosystem.

- *(docker)* Add build stage to Dockerfiles
 ([ba3692e](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/ba3692eb52dd146081014de05ffae9b6331d6ff6))  by @alfrunes


  The Dockerfiles are now self-contained by moving the build stage into
  the Dockerfile.

- *(docker)* Build images on BUILDPLATFORM
 ([44e5b7f](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/44e5b7f574f9437ccad0954dafbf75ea78f511f3))  by @alfrunes

  For consistent builds.

- *(make)* Update `docker` targets to use updated Dockerfiles
 ([11f26d6](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/11f26d6684f4732e3003cac69b4d03b11ae9924c))  by @alfrunes


  Refactored common parts to parent directory.

- *(make)* Change default target to `docker` and add variable TAGS
 ([92ac12a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/92ac12a512235c8b0013513935fe63bb712fea85))  by @alfrunes


  Containers are the primary build artifacts for this repo so it makes
  sense to build them by default.

- *(make)* Fix acceptance test targets after refactor
 ([70919bd](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/70919bdda6ca3af15bdd61f3cbe03f01156fe71c))  by @alfrunes


  Put common acceptance test targets in Makefile.common and made
  exceptions for `create-artifact-worker` and `reporting`.

- *(make)* Do not expand `go` shell commands unconditionally
 ([1c68b83](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/1c68b833d7823f6b0666e0f290ea0c073f482634))  by @alfrunes

  Removed the dependency on `docker-acceptance` for the
  `test-acceptance-run`.

- *(make)* `test-unit` target runs in same environment as build
 ([141ea40](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/141ea401f90b63d6667d403743b294908fb662b1))  by @alfrunes

- *(make)* Change TAGS behavior to always include required build tags
 ([5bae608](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/5bae608e706384cd5ebb88dbd6869291c1fa33d8))  by @alfrunes

- *(make)* Rename DOCKER_ARGS to DOCKER_BUILDARGS, TAGS to BUILDTAGS
 ([1a97891](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/1a978917316ce620ecc0fee01002ece409437765))  by @alfrunes


  It seems like Gitlab has a built in TAGS env variable which conflicts
  with the Make environment.

- *(make)* Add `docker-pull` target for pulling images
 ([37f4391](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/37f4391dee7624d583c68aba6235f7f61deddd76))  by @alfrunes

- *(make)* Define DOCKER_PLATFORM template as multiline variable
 ([0db0c9a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/0db0c9ad67430ba3bbe109cb9d5e8613eb2af621))  by @alfrunes

- *(make)* Fix tag override for `docker-acceptance`
 ([7f0b260](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/7f0b26011d422b539cdbdf6acbcb22156ac6a076))  by @alfrunes


  MENDER_IMAGE_TAG_TEST should set the tag when building the target.

- *(make)* Remove make 4.4 function `let`
 ([75f980e](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/75f980eb118298e0fcaf3dc08dcda0eb46131541))  by @alfrunes

- *(make)* Added target `docker-publish` for publishing images
 ([c400b04](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/c400b04c2c30a4a2e2ac5a2e2f53fddf44caeffb))  by @alfrunes

- *(make)* Split MENDER_PUBLISH_REGISTRY into registry and repository
 ([e27c770](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/e27c77001704218b36442641598e3b3d1ef65fd1))  by @alfrunes

- *(test)* Force serialize unit tests for deviceauth
 ([a0ab55e](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/a0ab55e6f84242b34b176520b7c2218e1c1d678e))  by @alfrunes





### Check


- Make `sed(1)` Linux compatible again
 ([1271396](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/1271396faf49b2220a39cd5e4ef7a1cd1cdee443))  by @alfrunes


  Replace flag `-i=''` with `-i.bak` and removing the files.




### Refac


- *(compose)* Refactor SeaweedFS topology and optimize startup/shutdown time
 ([fe7ee2e](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/fe7ee2eb37177521cb9ab060f551b2d441c86874))  by @alfrunes


  Instead of running SeaweedFS as a monolith using the `server` command,
  we explicitly launch all services in different containers. It appears
  that the `server` command has some issues when initializing the master
  and sometimes enter a deadlock the healthcheck interval is too low at
  startup. Moreover, running the services in different containers makes it
  easier to debug and interpret the logs.

- *(iotcore)* Break on errors instead of falling through
 ([733f8ab](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/733f8ab45cc8a76566b79d86507306b78742f324))  by @alfrunes


  Using long chains of fallthrough error conditions makes it very
  difficult to read and error prone to extend. Refactoring to use common
  coding patterns instead.

- Use an overlay directory to create Makefiles and Dockerfiles
 ([85e93e0](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/85e93e0081410b1fa295ddd6b639af969d3f47ac))  by @alfrunes


  Allows for easier individual customization required for accepatnce
  tests.
- Move compat tests to dedicated test suite
 ([059f437](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/059f4375d3b33073e711fdbf81212a2cd5dacfbb))  by @alfrunes




### Revert


- *(docker)* Revert generate-delta-worker dockerfile
 ([d205b3e](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/d205b3e4a279da0ee9660f3e14f828012ff0f5ab))  by @alfrunes


  Reverts the dockerfile to the upstream docker file with the two
  exceptions of copying the binaries from this repositories rather than
  relying on master docker images.

- Change docker entrypoint to launch workflows worker
 ([0d39c96](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-server/commit/0d39c964eeec8b833604b91be7f707c7ce1357a4))  by @alfrunes


  This was done by mistake when updating the Dockerfile for the monorepo.

## Mender 3.7.7

_Released 08.15.2024_

### Security fixes

* Fixed CVE-2024-46947 - SSRF issues in Mender Enterprise Server.
  See the official announcement for more information:
  [mender.io/blog/cve-2024-46947-cve-2024-47190-ssrf-issues-in-mender-enterprise-server](https://mender.io/blog/cve-2024-46947-cve-2024-47190-ssrf-issues-in-mender-enterprise-server)

### Changelogs

#### deviceconnect (1.5.1)

New changes in deviceconnect since 1.5.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* Connection status race on rapid reconnect

  Devices that reconnect too fast may result in a state where the
  persisted status shows “disconnected” while the device is actually
  connected. This especially happens when the network latency is very low
  (< 5ms) which causes the device to establish a new connection before the
  old request handler had time to mark it as closed.
  ([MEN-7333](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7333))

#### integration (3.7.7)

New changes in integration since 3.7.5:

  (SAML) ArtifactResolve requests, the backend no longer allows
  redirects and prevents making request to reserved IP ranges.
  ([MEN-7365](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7365))
* Replace SSO metadata on PUT requests

  This commit fixes the replacement semantics when updating the SSO
  metadata document for SAML and OpenID Connect. The former behavior uses
  a PATCH-like semantic which can lead to unwanted side-effects when
  changing mode between SAML and OIDC.
  ([MEN-7377](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7377))

#### deviceauth (3.6.0)

New changes in deviceauth since 3.5.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* propagate id data to inventory for all tenants case.
* Redis key prefix configuration not applied
  ([MEN-6926](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6926))

##### Features

* Allow tenant token to be an opaque string
  ([MEN-6502](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6502))

  ([MEN-6775](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6775))
* make service compatible with redis cluster

  Changes:
  - do not use redis databases;
  - use service/version specific prefix for all the keys;
  - change redis configuration - use connection string to create redis
    client;

  BREAKING CHANGE: Old redis_* configuration parameters are deprecated
  and most of them will not work. Use redis_connection_string and
  redis_key_prefix to configure redis cache client.
  ([MC-7056](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MC-7056))
* replace method for flushing database with method for suspending tenant

  We achive cache invalidation by incrementing tenant key version.

  related keys.
  ([MC-7056](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MC-7056))

##### Other

* fix cli acceptance tests
* use Pipeline instead of TxPipeline in the Throttle method

  Use of transaction in this particular case is unnecessary.

### Changelogs

#### deployments (4.5.0)

New changes in deployments since 4.4.1:

##### Bug Fixes

* increment deployment total size only if new artifact has been assigned
* add undocumented groups field to deployment object
* fix model of the last device deployment status request
* save correct status of last finished deployment
* Delete device deployment history incorrectly triggering reindex

  The endpoint was missing the reporting feature flag check, which caused
  it to send reindexing request even though the reporting service is
  disabled.
  ([MEN-6614](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6614))

##### Features

* add artifact information to deployment device information
  ([MEN-3995](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3995))
* track and show deployment total size
  ([MEN-3994](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3994))
* Retrieve signed direct upload URL for artifacts

  This is the first part of the implementation of the direct artifact
  upload feature. This commit introduce a new API that issues signed
  upload URLs for transferring artifacts directly to the storage backend
  without involoving the Mender backend services.
  POST /api/management/v1/deployments/artifacts/directupload
  ([MEN-5989](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5989))
* Direct artifact upload API

  Users can upload artifacts asynchronously to the object storage backend
  using the API to generate a signed upload link:
  POST /api/management/v1/deployments/artifacts/directupload
  The response contains a link and an allocated artifact ID. Once the
  artifact is uploaded, calling another API will make the backend parse
  the artifact and make it available for devices:
  POST /api/management/v1/deployments/artifacts/directupload/:id/complete
  ([MEN-6337](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6337))
* New command 'storage-daemon' for cleaning up expired objects from storage
  ([MEN-6339](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6339))
* Store device deployments status separately
  ([MEN-6423](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6423))
* internal endpoint to get the latest device deployment statuses
  ([MEN-6421](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6421))
* Skip verification and download of the artifact via DEPLYOMENTS_DIRECT_UPLOAD_SKIP_VERIFY
  ([MEN-6474](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6474))
* Add configuration option to skip signing headers for s3
  ([MEN-6501](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6501))

##### Other

* docs(management API spec): extend device object with image info

  /deployments/{deployment_id}/devices/list endpoint will return list of
  device objects with info about images assigned to given device;
  The same is true for deprecated /deployments/{deployment_id}/devices
  ([MEN-3995](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3995))
* docs(management API spec): extend main deployment object with statistics
  ([MEN-3994](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3994))
* refac: refactor GetDeploymentForDeviceWithCurrent method

  Changes:
  - code refactoring
  - assign artifact to device deployment object even
    if given artifact has already been installed
  ([MEN-6363](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6363))
* fix(list device deployments): device ID is not always UUID
  ([MEN-6376](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6376))
* update of the mender-artifact including zstd compression
  ([MEN-6617](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6617))

#### useradm (1.19.0)

New changes in useradm since 1.18.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* delete user tokens when deleting user
* Make username/email case-insensitive

  This commit forces the internal representation of the username/email
  addresses to be lowercase. This means that any users that signed up with
  an email containing uppercase characters will be locked out from their
  account. To fix this issue, the server maintainer should run the
  following mongodb migration script:
  ```
  let tAdm = db.getSiblingDB("tenantadm");
  tAdm.users.find({}).forEach((doc) => {
    if (doc.name.toLowerCase() != doc.name) {
      print(
        "Converting to lower case (<tenantid>/<userid>): " +
          doc.tenant_id +
          "/" +
          doc._id
      );
      tAdm.users.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { name: doc.name.toLowerCase() } }
      );
      let usrAdm = db.getSiblingDB("useradm-" + doc.tenant_id);
      usrAdm.users.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { email: doc.name.toLowerCase() } }
      );
    }
  });
  let usrAdm = db.getSiblingDB("useradm");
  usrAdm.users.find({}).forEach((doc) => {
    if (doc.email.toLowerCase() != doc.email) {
      print("Converting to lower case (<userid>):" + doc._id);
      usrAdm.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { email: doc.email.toLowerCase() } }
      );
    }

New changes in deployments-enterprise since 1.8.1:

* Disallow empty batches in phased rollouts
Previously there was a possibility to end up with an empty batch, due
to the formula used in the calculation for the number of devices which
is based on extracting a percentage number of devices from the total. Thus
if the total is so small, that a percentage below some number rounds to zero,
the batch would be empty. Now that same input will return an error.

will be prompted for the password.
* Verify that empty batches returns a 400 error
Added a test for verifying that deployments-enterprise returns a 400 error
in case of the number of devices in a batch being empty due to rounding
errors in relation to the formula used for determining the number of devices
in a batch. ([MEN-2838](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2838))
* Backend Integration tests always print "tests failed"; fix.

Remove the Python dependency in the demo script, to decrease the dependency
surface of the demo script.
Now the Mender-Artifact and Mender versions are parsed from the
docker-compose.client.yml and other-components.yml files through a simple AWK
script instead.
